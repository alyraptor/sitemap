# Site Map Web Scraper

- __**Client:**__ BKD
- __**Timeframe:**__ Early July to September 2017
- __**Technologies:**__ PHP, PHP libraries
- __**Description:**__ I was originally tasked with making an Excel spreadsheet by hand, which would include a lot of information for each of the hundreds of pages of the BKD site. I set out to create a script that would automate this for me. In the end, I created something that not only met the original expectations, but largely exceeded them by allowing us to have a new, updated version whenever we want. \*Note: All of the information in this script is pulled from public information on BKDâ€™s site. Any internal notes have been removed as well as some small amounts of information to protect privacy.
- __**Technical Overview:**__ The backbone of this script is the PHP function file_get_contents. From there, I used a third-party library called Simple PHP DOM to navigate the called file, and filter it into its component parts. I then used a third-party library called PHPExcel, to output everything into an Excel spreadsheet.
- __**Next Steps:**__ This project is finished.
